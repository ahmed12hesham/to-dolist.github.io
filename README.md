<h1 align="center">To-Do Tasks List</h1>


### Goal

This is To-Do tasks list application. I coded this project to practice on my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6), and jQuery in a real project.

### Benefits

Here are some ideas to benefit from this project:

- Take this project as a task and try to make it, and if you could not do a specific section, see how I make it in the source code (use comments to reach this section).
- Extract a code of a specific section and use it in your project.
- Review source code to see how other people code their projects.
- Edit on this project after studying its code well, to know how to work in pair-programming with other people
- Upgrade this project, and add your own sections or pages
